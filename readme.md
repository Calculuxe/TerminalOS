This is the official github page for TerminalOS. This is how you install. Download all the files(except this one) and create a folder in C:\ (Yes, I know this is only a windows thing, I don't know how MacOS works, but I will make a MacOS edition) then add the downloaded files to this folder. If you want to start the python file make sure python is installed and all modules:
import os
import platform
import random
import math
import pygame
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import datetime
import time
import threading
import pytz
import sys
If you are going to start the exe, then just set it up like normal! Done!
